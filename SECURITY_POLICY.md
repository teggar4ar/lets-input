# Security Policy

## Application Security Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Input Penduduk application.

## Security Middleware

The application implements the following security middleware:

1. **SecureHeaders**: Adds critical security headers to all responses.
   - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
   - X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
   - X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
   - Content-Security-Policy: Restricts content sources
   - Strict-Transport-Security: Optional, applied only when using HTTPS

2. **PreventXssAttacks**: Sanitizes inputs and detects XSS attack patterns.
   - Monitors for common XSS vectors
   - Sanitizes user input
   - Encodes dangerous characters

3. **SqlInjectionProtection**: Detects and blocks SQL injection attempts.
   - Pattern matching for SQL attack vectors
   - Blocks dangerous SQL keywords

4. **ValidateFileUploads**: Verifies file integrity and safety.
   - MIME type validation
   - Extension validation
   - Size limits
   - Malicious content scanning

5. **DetectSuspiciousRequests**: Identifies potentially malicious requests.
   - Monitors suspicious URIs
   - Checks for malicious user agents
   - Blocks common attack patterns

6. **RateLimitLogin**: Prevents brute force attacks on authentication.
   - Limits login attempts
   - Implements progressive delays

7. **StrongPasswordPolicy**: Enforces strong password requirements.
   - Minimum length requirements
   - Character complexity enforcement
   - Common password prevention

8. **ApiRateLimiter**: Rate limits API requests.
   - Prevents API abuse
   - Adds rate limit headers

## Database Security

1. **Query Safety**
   - Prepared statements for all database queries
   - Parameter binding
   - SQL injection prevention
   - Strict mode enabled

2. **Access Control**
   - Least privilege principle
   - Row-level security where applicable

## Authentication Security

1. **Password Security**
   - Bcrypt hashing algorithm
   - Minimum 12 character passwords
   - Complexity requirements
   - Brute force protection

2. **Session Security**
   - Encrypted sessions
   - Secure cookies (when using HTTPS)
   - Session timeout (60 minutes)
   - HTTP-only cookies
   - SameSite cookie policy

## File Upload Security

1. **Upload Restrictions**
   - Allowlist of permitted file types
   - Size limitations
   - MIME type validation
   - Content scanning

2. **Storage Security**
   - Files stored outside web root
   - Randomized filenames
   - Proper permissions

## Error Handling

1. **Production Error Handling**
   - Custom error pages
   - No stack traces or sensitive data in errors
   - Proper logging

2. **Input Validation**
   - All inputs validated
   - Strict type checking
   - Form request validation

## Infrastructure Security

1. **HTTPS Enforcement**
   - All traffic over HTTPS
   - HTTP requests redirected to HTTPS
   - Strict Transport Security

2. **Server Hardening**
   - Latest security patches
   - Firewall configuration
   - Principle of least privilege

## Security Monitoring

1. **Log Management**
   - Security events logged
   - Suspicious activity monitoring
   - Audit trails for sensitive operations

2. **Regular Security Scans**
   - Vulnerability scanning
   - Dependency monitoring
   - Code scanning

## Incident Response

1. **Security Incident Procedure**
   - Process for handling security breaches
   - Notification procedure
   - Remediation steps

## Compliance

1. **Data Protection**
   - Sensitive data encryption
   - PII protection
   - Compliance with relevant regulations
